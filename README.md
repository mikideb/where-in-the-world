# Where in the world?

## Introduction

This project was made with sketches by the frontendmentor.io website.
The website gets and presents data about countries all over the world, with the ability to filter countries by region or search manually by name. The website is able to switch themes (light or dark).

The technologies I implemented in this project: React, JSX, CSS Grid/Flexbox, Redux and Redux Thunk (state management and fetching data from API) and axios.
